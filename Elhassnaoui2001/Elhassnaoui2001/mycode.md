### Instructions on AI vs ML vs DL

Artificial Intelligence (AI): Refers to machines mimicking human intelligence tasks.
- Applications include chatbots, robotics, etc.

Machine Learning (ML): A subset of AI focusing on algorithms trained on data for predictive tasks.
- Examples include recommendation systems and fraud detection.

Deep Learning (DL): A subset of ML using neural networks to execute complex tasks like image and speech recognition.
- Requires large datasets and computational power.
